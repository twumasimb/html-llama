      "Great! Here are some ideas for creating webpage prompts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. User-generated content: Allow users to submit their own ideas for webpages and feature the best ones on your site. This can be a great way to encourage user engagement and create a sense of community around your website.\n",
      "2. Niche topics: Identify niche topics that are not well-represented online and create a webpage dedicated to these topics. For example, you could create a webpage about the history of a particular region or the culture of a specific ethnic group.\n",
      "3. Personal stories: Encourage users to share their personal stories and experiences on your website. This can be a powerful way to connect with readers and create a sense of empathy and understanding.\n",
      "4. How-to guides: Create a webpage that provides step-by-step instructions for completing a particular task or achieving a specific goal. For example, you could create a webpage that teaches users how to start their own business or learn a new skill.\n",
      "5. Listicles: Create a webpage that consists of a list of interesting topics or trivia related to a particular theme. For example, you could create a webpage that lists the top 10 most popular tourist destinations in a particular country or the top 5 most bizarre foods from around the world.\n",
      "6. Interactive tools: Create a webpage that allows users to interact with your content in some way. For example, you could create a quiz or a game that tests users' knowledge of a particular subject.\n",
      "7. Infographics: Create a webpage that consists of visually appealing infographics related to a particular topic. Infographics are great for sharing information in a quick and easy-to-understand format.\n",
      "8. Personalized content: Use user data to create personalized content recommendations for each user. For example, you could use user search history or browsing behavior to suggest articles or webpages that are relevant to their interests.\n",
      "9. Collaborative projects: Create a webpage that allows users to collaborate on a particular project or task. For example, you could create a webpage where users can work together to build a community garden or create a shared art piece.\n",
      "10. Virtual events: Host virtual events on your website, such as webinars, workshops, or conferences. This can be a great way to connect with users and provide value to them without having to physically meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope these ideas are helpful in getting started with creating webpage prompts! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the ideas listed above.\n",

      "* Size of the button: 100x30 pixels\n",
      "\n",

    "Okay, I need to create a webpage for a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have a modern, user-friendly design with real-time results. Let me break this down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll start with the HTML structure. The calculator should have a display area where the current input and results will be shown. Then, there should be buttons for numbers and operations. \n",
    "I'll organize these buttons in a grid layout to make it neat and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'll think about the CSS styling. To make it look modern, I'll choose a clean font like Arial, set a background color that's light but not too harsh, and ensure the calculator is centered on \n",
    "the page. The display area should be wide enough with a readable font size. For the buttons, I'll use a grid layout to arrange them neatly, add some padding, and style the operators differently so \n",
    "they stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, onto JavaScript. The main functions will involve handling button clicks, updating the display, performing calculations, and clearing the input. I'll need event listeners for each button. When \n",
    "a number or operator is clicked, it should update the display. For operations like addition or multiplication, I'll store the first operand and perform the calculation when the equals button is \n",
    "pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want to include keyboard support so users can input using their keyboard, which improves usability. I'll add an event listener for keydown events and map keys to corresponding actions, like \n",
    "pressing 'Enter' to calculate the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing each part as I go is important. For example, after setting up the HTML and CSS, I'll check if the layout looks good on different screen sizes. Then, ensuring that each button click updates \n",
    "the display correctly and performs the right operation. I'll also test edge cases, like dividing by zero or handling multiple operations in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll review the code to make sure it's clean and well-commented. This makes it easier for others to understand and maintain. I'll also consider future enhancements, like adding more \n",
    "operations or improving the error handling, but those can be added later.\n",

       "\"Okay, I need to create a webpage for a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have a modern, user-friendly design with real-time results. Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll start with the HTML structure. The calculator should have a display area where the current input and results will be shown. Then, there should be buttons for numbers and operations. \\nI'll organize these buttons in a grid layout to make it neat and easy to use.\\n\\nNext, I'll think about the CSS styling. To make it look modern, I'll choose a clean font like Arial, set a background color that's light but not too harsh, and ensure the calculator is centered on \\nthe page. The display area should be wide enough with a readable font size. For the buttons, I'll use a grid layout to arrange them neatly, add some padding, and style the operators differently so \\nthey stand out.\\n\\nNow, onto JavaScript. The main functions will involve handling button clicks, updating the display, performing calculations, and clearing the input. I'll need event listeners for each button. When \\na number or operator is clicked, it should update the display. For operations like addition or multiplication, I'll store the first operand and perform the calculation when the equals button is \\npressed.\\n\\nI also want to include keyboard support so users can input using their keyboard, which improves usability. I'll add an event listener for keydown events and map keys to corresponding actions, like \\npressing 'Enter' to calculate the result.\\n\\nTesting each part as I go is important. For example, after setting up the HTML and CSS, I'll check if the layout looks good on different screen sizes. Then, ensuring that each button click updates \\nthe display correctly and performs the right operation. I'll also test edge cases, like dividing by zero or handling multiple operations in a row.\\n\\nFinally, I'll review the code to make sure it's clean and well-commented. This makes it easier for others to understand and maintain. I'll also consider future enhancements, like adding more \\noperations or improving the error handling, but those can be added later.\""

       " 'reasoning': 'Alright, I need to create a calculator webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that\\'s accessible according to the given guidelines. Let me break down the steps I should take.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll start with the HTML structure. The page needs a proper document structure, so I\\'ll include a doctype, html element with lang set to \"en\", head with title, and body. The calculator will be placed inside a container div to center it on the page.\\n\\nNext, the calculator itself. It should have a display area for the current input and possibly previous operations. Using semantic elements is important, so I\\'ll use divs with classes like display for the screen. Each button should be a button element for better accessibility and keyboard focus.\\n\\nFor styling, CSS is necessary to make it look modern. I\\'ll use Flexbox to center the calculator on the page. The buttons need to be arranged in a grid, so I\\'ll apply Grid layout. Styling each button with different colors based on their function (numbers, operators) will improve usability. I\\'ll ensure that focus states are present for each button using outline and box-shadow properties.\\n\\nAccessibility is key here. All form elements must have labels, but buttons don\\'t require them as they\\'re self-descriptive. However, the display areas should be labeled appropriately for screen readers. I\\'ll use aria-labels for inputs to describe their purpose.\\n\\nKeyboard accessibility is another point. Users should be able to interact using only the keyboard. So, I\\'ll add event listeners for keydown events on the calculator container. Each key press (like numbers and operators) will trigger the corresponding button click functions.\\n\\nThe JavaScript part handles calculations. I\\'ll create a Calculator class to manage the state—current and previous operands, operations, and methods to perform calculations. Functions like appendNumber, chooseOperation, compute, and updateDisplay will be essential. Error handling is important too; if division by zero occurs, it should display an error message.\\n\\nTesting with screen readers isn\\'t possible right now, but I\\'ll ensure that the structure is semantic and labels are correctly applied. Color contrast is another consideration; I\\'ll use a light background for buttons to meet WCAG standards.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll validate the HTML and CSS to ensure no errors, which helps in making the page robust. The code should be clean, well-commented, and follow best practices for maintainability.',\n",

      "# Web Accessibility Requirements\n",
      "When generating HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code, adhere to the following accessibility guidelines based on WCAG principles. These requirements ensure that web content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, including those using assistive technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Perceivable\n",
      "The following guidelines ensure that web content is perceivable by all users:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Images and iframes must have alt attributes**\n",
      "\t* All `<img>` elements must include descriptive `alt` attributes\n",
      "\t* All `<iframe>` elements must include `alt` attributes to provide context\n",
      "\t* Examples:\n",
      "\t\t+ Incorrect: `<iframe src=\"https://www.w3schools.com\"></iframe>`\n",
      "\t\t+ Correct: `<iframe src=\"https://www.w3schools.com\" title=\"W3Schools Free Online Web Tutorials\"></iframe>`\n",
      "2. **Form elements must be properly labeled**\n",
      "\t* All form controls (buttons, inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, file inputs, select elements) must have associated text labels\n",
      "\t* Labels must contain descriptive text content\n",
      "\t* Use `<label>` elements properly associated with form controls\n",
      "\t* Only password inputs should have alt attributes among input elements\n",
      "3. **Avoid deprecated formatting elements**\n",
      "\t* Don't use `<b>`, `<i>`, or `<font>` tags\n",
      "\t* Use `<strong>` or `<em>` for emphasis, or CSS for styling\n",
      "4. **Media elements must be user-controlled**\n",
      "\t* Avoid `autoplay` attributes for audio/video elements\n",
      "\t* Always include `controls` attributes for media elements\n",
      "\n",
      "## Operable\n",
      "The following guidelines ensure that web content is operable by all users:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ensure keyboard accessibility**\n",
      "\t* For any element with `onmousedown` events, include corresponding `onkeydown` events\n",
      "\t* Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible\n",
      "2. **Avoid automatic page refreshes and movement**\n",
      "\t* Don't use `<meta>` refresh with timeouts\n",
      "\t* Don't use the deprecated `<marquee>` element\n",
      "3. **Provide proper document structure**\n",
      "\t* Include a non-empty `<title>` element\n",
      "\t* All anchor (`<a>`) elements must contain text content\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understandable\n",
      "The following guidelines ensure that web content is understandable by all users:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Specify document language**\n",
      "\t* Include a valid `lang` attribute on the HTML element\n",
      "\t* Use standard language codes (e.g., \"en\", \"es\", \"fr\")\n",
      "2. **Maintain clear form structure**\n",
      "\t* Avoid multiple labels for a single input element\n",
      "\n",
      "## Robust\n",
      "The following guidelines ensure that web content is robust and works across different devices and browsers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ensure valid markup**\n",
      "\t* Use unique ID attributes (no duplicates)\n",
      "\t* Include complete start and end tags for all elements\n",
      "\t* Follow HTML5 standards\n",
      "\n",
      "## General Best Practices\n",
      "The following best practices should be followed to ensure that web content is accessible and usable:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use semantic HTML elements** (`<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.)\n",
      "2. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**\n",
      "3. **Provide clear focus indicators**\n",
      "4. **Test with screen readers when possible**\n",
      "5. **Validate code against accessibility standards**\n",
      "\n",
      "When generating code, prioritize these accessibility features even if they aren't explicitly requested, as they are fundamental to creating inclusive web experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Examples\n",
      "The following examples illustrate common mistakes and their corrections:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Incorrect: `<input type=\"number\" alt=\"quantity\" id=\"quantity\" name=\"quantity\" min=\"1\" required>`\n",
      "* Correct: `<input type=\"number\" id=\"quantity\" name=\"quantity\" min=\"1\" required>`\n",
